# Basic-Cloning
Tutorial to demonstrate basic cloning in git. This will demonstrate how you can work on a project from two different computers or how to work together 
with others in a very simple way.

## New empty folder

Go to the local repository.
```
Git Command:
$ cd "/H/Udvikling/Git/Tutorial/Basic cloning"
This will change to the local repository
```
It is important to realize that you can use an arbitrary folder name, but is good practice to use the same folder name on both computeres.

Clone in to the new empty folder
```
Git Command:
$ clone https://github.com/koklapperne/Basic-Cloning
This will download the remote to the local folder and create repository
```

## Existing local repository
